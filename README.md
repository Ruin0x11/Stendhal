# Stendhal

A modified version of the [Stendhal](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/Themes/tree/master/Stendhal) theme by [tatou-tatou](https://github.com/tatou-tatou) for bspwm, without patched packages.

Various things might be broken, but it shouldn't matter too much if you don't use the mouse interaction a lot.

## Requirements
`bspwm`
`sxhkd`
`lemonbar`
`dunst`
`dmenu2`
`compton`
`devmon`
`amixer`
`acpi`
`xinput`
`clock` (from sutils)

### Optional
`scrot` (screenshot hotkey)
`mpd` (music player)
`plank` (dock)
`udevil` (rootless mount/unmount list)
`setxkbmap` (keyboard layout switching)
`light` (MacBook screen brightness)
`kbdlight` (MacBook keyboard lights)
`feh` (for wallpaper)
`offlineimap` (mail count)
`mygtkmenu` (menu when clicking in top-left corner)

### Replacable
These are the default programs I set to launch, but they can easily be replaced in the sxhkdrc.
`urxvt` (with xft font support)
`emacs`
`surf`
`chromium`

## Installation
Install the required programs. The optional programs add various useful features.

Symlink everything in `Core` and `Scripts` to a folder on your path.

Install the included fonts.

Place the included `.xinitrc` in your home directory. Set the wallpaper with `feh` or similar within it.

Use `Tatou.Xresources` as your `.Xresources` for the terminal theme.

### Mail Notification
The mail notification depends on the `mail-sync` and `panel-mail` scripts. Setup `offlineimap` to sync your mail into a Maildir inside the `mail-sync` script, then indicate the directory within `panel-mail`. Up to two mailboxes can be shown by default. The command to run when clicking the notification can also be changed in `panel-mail`.
